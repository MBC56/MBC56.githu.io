            <p>May 4th 2023 - curerent</p>
            <p>While going to collage I have a part time job at FedEx where I work at the warehouse in the early morning and then usually go home or to school right after work. The job can be difficult since there is a lot of heavy stuff every once and a while, but the people and managers there are nice and one of them used to do coding.</p>
            
            <h2>Culvers</h2>
            <p>crew team member, shift leader, assistant manager</p>
            <p>june 2019 - july 2022</p>

            <p>While working at culvers was just a job for extra cash in high school, I did learn a lot of people skills and talked to many people while making sure my crew was doing fine both mentally and physically. It did start with me being a crew member and at the time my job was simple, but when I became shift leader that did give me more responsibility.</p>
